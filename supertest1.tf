Explanation:

Custom Role Creation:

Three custom roles (custom_role_0, custom_role_1, and custom_role_2) are created based on the provided permissions. The title, description, and role_id fields are placeholders and should be replaced with appropriate values.
IAM Changes:

aditv@google.com:
The roles/securitycenter.admin role is removed from aditv@google.com and replaced with custom_role_0.
pkhushalani@google.com:
The roles/chroniclesm.admin and roles/resourcemanager.folderIamAdmin is removed.
The roles/recommender.iamAdmin role is removed and the roles/recommender.iamViewer role is added.
The roles/securitycenter.admin role is removed and replaced with roles/securitycenter.assetsViewer.
The roles roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin, roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator, roles/iam.securityAdmin are removed and replaced with custom_role_0, custom_role_0, custom_role_1 and custom_role_2 respectively.
Resource replacement

Since the binding module has only one member after the principal removal, it is removed entirely from the code.
The member modules are removed for the target user.
Disclaimers:

The title, description, and role_id fields in the google_organization_iam_custom_role resources are placeholders and should be replaced with appropriate values.
Ensure that the Google Cloud provider is properly configured with the correct project ID and region.
It is recommended to review the generated Terraform script before applying it to avoid any unintended consequences.
It might be the case that there are already custom roles with same permissions. In that case, you dont have to create these custom roles.
The custom roles added has a naming convention of 'custom_role_{index}_{principal}'. You can change it as per your need.
Please note that all the replace role recommendations are being applied by removing the unnecessary roles and adding the needed roles.
The removal of roles/chronicle.admin from pkhushalani@google.com caused the removal of module. If this was not the intention, please revert that change.
Please note that, the google provider version is hardcoded to be 4.68.0. Please change it to the latest one if needed.
To apply this Terraform script:

Save the script to a file (e.g., main.tf).
Run terraform init to initialize the Terraform environment.
Run terraform plan to preview the changes that will be made.
Run terraform apply to apply the changes.
